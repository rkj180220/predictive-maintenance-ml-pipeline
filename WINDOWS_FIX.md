# Windows Encoding Fix

## Problem
When running the pipeline on Windows, you may encounter this error:
```
'charmap' codec can't encode character '\u2265' in position 2069: character maps to <undefined>
```

## Root Cause
- Windows uses `cp1252` (or `cp1250`) encoding by default when writing files
- The code uses Unicode characters like ≥ (greater than or equal), ≤ (less than or equal), and other special symbols
- These characters are not supported in the Windows default encoding

## Solution
All file write operations have been updated to use UTF-8 encoding explicitly.

### Files Modified (9 files):
1. `src/business_understanding/problem_definition.py` - Added `encoding='utf-8'` to save_report() and export_json()
2. `src/data_ingestion/data_validator.py` - Added `encoding='utf-8'` to save_validation_report()
3. `src/data_ingestion/kaggle_downloader.py` - Added `encoding='utf-8'` to kaggle.json writer
4. `src/dataops/dashboard.py` - Added `encoding='utf-8'` to HTML dashboard writer
5. `src/dataops/monitoring.py` - Added `encoding='utf-8'` to metrics export
6. `src/eda/feature_importance.py` - Added `encoding='utf-8'` to save_report() and export_json()
7. `src/eda/correlation_analysis.py` - Added `encoding='utf-8'` to save_report() and export_json()
8. `src/eda/statistical_analysis.py` - Added `encoding='utf-8'` to save_report() and export_json()
9. `src/eda/report_generator.py` - Added `encoding='utf-8'` to JSON and text report writers

### Changes Made:
**Before:**
```python
with open(filepath, 'w') as f:
    f.write(content)
```

**After:**
```python
with open(filepath, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
    f.write(content)
```

**For JSON files:**
```python
with open(filepath, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f:
    json.dump(data, f, indent=2, ensure_ascii=False)
```

## How to Apply the Fix
If you've already cloned the repository, pull the latest changes:
```bash
git pull origin main
```

Or download the updated files and replace the old ones.

## Testing
After applying the fix, the pipeline should run successfully on Windows without encoding errors:
```bash
python main.py
```

## Why UTF-8?
- UTF-8 is the universal standard encoding that supports all Unicode characters
- It's compatible across Windows, macOS, and Linux
- It's the recommended encoding for Python 3
- It handles special characters, emojis, and international text properly

## Additional Notes
- This fix is backward compatible - it works on all operating systems
- No functionality changes, only encoding specification
- The `ensure_ascii=False` parameter in JSON dumps allows proper Unicode character output

## Contact
If you encounter any other issues, please report them with:
1. Your operating system (Windows version)
2. Python version (`python --version`)
3. Full error traceback
4. The specific command you ran
